## Code of Conduct

### 1. Purpose

A primary goal of [python_cafe] is to be inclusive to the largest number of contributors, with the most varied and diverse backgrounds possible. As such, we are committed to providing a friendly, safe, and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, ability, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and religion (or lack thereof).

This Code of Conduct outlines our expectations for all those who participate in our community, as well as the consequences for unacceptable behavior.

### 2. Expected Behavior

We invite all those who participate in [python_cafe] to help us create safe and positive experiences for everyone. Specifically:

- **Be welcoming** and inclusive.
- **Be respectful**. Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners.
- **Try to understand** different perspectives.
- **Refrain** from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech.
- **Be mindful** of your surroundings and of your fellow participants.

### 3. Unacceptable Behavior

Unacceptable behaviors include: intimidating, harassing, abusive, discriminatory, derogatory, or demeaning speech or actions. Harassment includes: harmful or prejudicial verbal or written comments related to gender, sexual orientation, race, religion, disability; inappropriate use of nudity and/or sexual images; inappropriate depictions of violence; personal attacks; unwelcome attention or stalking; and sustained disruption of talks or other events.

### 4. Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior

Unacceptable behavior from any community member, including sponsors, contributors, and those with decision-making authority, will not be tolerated. Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately.

If a community member engages in unacceptable behavior, we may take any action deemed appropriate, up to and including a temporary ban or permanent expulsion from the community without warning.


### 5. Addressing Grievances

If you feel you have been falsely or unfairly accused of violating this Code of Conduct, you should notify the project maintainers. They will assess the situation and determine the appropriate next steps.
