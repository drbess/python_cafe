# Uncomment the code below and how to evaluate a hypotenuse

# This program evaluates the hypotenuse c.
# a and b are the lengths of the legs.
# a = 3.0
# b = 4.0
# c = (a ** 2 + b ** 2) ** 0.5  # We use ** instead of square root.
# print("c =", c)
# print("This is what a comment looks like '# This line should stay commented out'")
